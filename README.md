The system is a prototype of a blood bank form that captures the details of blood donors and stores it in an Excel Sheet. Once the blood is utilized and the donor's unique ID is entered, the system automatically generates an email to notify the donor that their blood is being utilized. These confirmation emails provide the donor with a sense of satisfaction that their donation is not wasted and serve as a motivational factor for continued charitable acts.
NOTE: For future implementation, In place of Excel, any database may be used and a QR code can be used instead of a unique ID
